Non-Interactive Weather Display (NIWD)

A Pyside based full screen weather widget which displays current conditions in two locations, 
as well as hourly forcast temperature and chance of precipitation for both locations. NIWD also
also features a historical past hour radar and an at-a-glance high temperature indicator (at this
time it uses frog images).
